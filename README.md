Connect 4 Game in JS:

Guidelines / Rules:
- [x] Before you start, send me a time estimate
- [x] Get the game to a working state
- [ ] Polish UI/UX as much as possible
- [x] Make it fill the entire screen
- [x] Make it responsive down to mobile
- [x] assume modern browsers

Bonus (totally optional):
- [ ] Add falling animation (circles falling down)
- [ ] AI for User vs AI games
- [ ] Add a "Game Over" screen
- [ ] Track score, making it persistent (w/o a backend)
- [ ] use only ES6

Description
 
you are to finalize the current code, the end goal is a fully functional connect-four game
while documenting each of your steps committing this to an either public or private git repo
(which you need to make available to the reviewer), the game should be a user vs user game on which
you click a column and drops a coin, first to click is yellow
